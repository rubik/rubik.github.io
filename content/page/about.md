# About me
I'm a Senior Software Engineer with a focus on Python development. I graduated
in Engineering Mathematics at Politecnico di Torino, in Italy. I have a
long-standing passion for programming and computer science in general.

After a brief stint as a data science contractor, at the moment my interests
are geared towards distributed systems and software architecture and design.
