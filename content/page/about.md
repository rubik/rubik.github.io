# About me
I'm an undergrad student in Engineering Mathematics at Politecnico di Torino,
in Italy. I have a long-standing passion for programming and computer science
in general. I started dabbling in Python when I was 13 years old and never
stopped.

At the moment my interest is geared towards data science: primarily data
visualization and statistical models. I just started studying machine learning
and I intend to learn R in the near future.

#### Projects
My projects are on github at:
