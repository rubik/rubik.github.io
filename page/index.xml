      <description>About me I&amp;rsquo;m an undergrad student in Engineering Mathematics at Politecnico di Torino, in Italy. I have a long-standing passion for programming and computer science in general. I started dabbling in Python when I was 13 years old and never stopped.
At the moment my interest is geared towards data science: primarily data visualization and statistical models. I just started studying machine learning and I intend to learn R in the near future.</description>
